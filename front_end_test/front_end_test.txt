New/Mode Coding Test: Voting System

Task:
Using HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript or jQuery create a static web page that gives the user the ability to choose between the five candidates found in the attached CSV file.  When a candidate is selected, reveal the biographical information of that candidate alongside a call to action that encourages the user to vote.  Once a user has voted, they should see a message thanking them for voting.

Design, usability and accessibility are key to this exercise and can be tackled as you see fit.
